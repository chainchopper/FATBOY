## ü§ñ How the AI Works

1.  **Scan:** User scans a barcode.
2.  **Fetch:** Product data (especially ingredients) is fetched from the Open Food Facts API.
3.  **Parse & Classify:** Our fine-tuned model classifies each ingredient in the list (e.g., `"ascorbic acid"` -> `vitamin_c`, `"natural"`).
4.  **Judge:** A rule engine compares the classified ingredients against the user's personalized "avoid list."
5.  **Verdict:** A final verdict is generated and displayed to the user with a detailed breakdown.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React Native
*   **State Management:** React Context API / Redux Toolkit
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (user data), Redis (caching)
*   **AI/ML:** Python (PyTorch/TensorFlow) for model training, TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference (future)
*   **API:** Open Food Facts
*   **Testing:** Jest, React Native Testing Library
