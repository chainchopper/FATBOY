## üèÅ Getting Started

You can run Fanalogy in two ways: locally for development or via Docker for a production-like environment.

### üê≥ Method 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the app running in a consistent environment.

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Steps:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fanalogy-app.git
    cd fanalogy-app
    ```
2.  **Build and run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3.  **Access the app:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   **Note:** If port `3000` is in use on your machine, `docker-compose` will fail. You can manually change the host port mapping in `docker-compose.yaml` (e.g., `ports: - "8080:80"`) and then access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

### üíª Method 2: Local Development

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js (v18 or newer)
*   Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

**Steps:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fanalogy-app.git
    cd fanalogy-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Launch the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will automatically try to launch the app on ports `3000`, `8080`, `4200`, or `4300` until an available port is found. Open your browser to the port indicated in the console.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

Our journey has just begun! Here's a glimpse of what's next:

-   [ ] **Food Diary & Performance Tracking:** Log your meals and get AI-powered feedback on your goals.
